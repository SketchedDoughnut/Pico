# Fixing your pico
If at any point you happen to have broken your pico and it will not boot and you can not put new firmware on it to fix this problem, you can do a "flash nuke". At the bottom of [this page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html#resetting-flash-memory) there is a download in order to do this. Just install the UF2 file, then flash the firmware on your pico as normal.
